     car loan is sought,

    <h2>What is an EMI?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Equated Monthly Instalment 
 (or EMI) consists of the principal 
 portion of the loan amount and the interest. 
 Therefore, EMI = principal amount + interest 
 paid on the Car Loan. The EMI, usually, 
 remains fixed for the entire tenure of your loan, 
 and it is to be repaid over the tenure of the loan on a monthly basis.
