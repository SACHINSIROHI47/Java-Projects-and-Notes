<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>People like you and me cannot just go to a stock exchange and buy and sell shares. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>Only the members of the stock exchange can. These members are called brokers and they buy and sell shares on our behalf. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>So, if you want to start investing in shares, you can do it only through a broker. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>Every stockbroker has to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which is the stock market regulator. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>You can either choose a broker (who is directly registered with SEBI) or a sub-broker (people licensed by brokers to work under them). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>The Bombay Stock Exchange. directory or the National Stock Exchange .Web site will give you a list of brokers affiliated to them. Most of them entertain retail clients.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>If you want an online broker, you can start by looking at the Web sites of some well-known online players: Sharekhan Kotak Securities 5paise and India Bulls. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=4><STRONG>2. Get a demat account </STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>Gone are the days when shares were held as physical certificates. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>Today, they are held in an electronic form in demat accounts. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>Demat refers to a dematerialised account. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>Let's say your portfolio of shares looks like this: 40 shares of Infosys, 25 of Wipro, 45 of HLL and 100 of ACC. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>They will show in your demat account. You don't have to possess any physical certificates showing you own these shares. They are all held electronically in your account. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>Periodically, you will get a demat statement telling you what shares you have in your demat account. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>How to get a demat account</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>To get a demat account, you will have to approach a Depository Participant. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>A depository is a place where an investor's stocks are held in electronic form. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>There are only two depositories in India -- the National Securities Depository Ltd and the Central Depository Services Ltd. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>The depository has agents who are called Depository Participants. In India, there are over a hundred DPs. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>Think of it like a bank. The head office, where all the technology rests and the details of all the accounts are held, is like the depository. The DPs are like the branches of banks that cater to individuals. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>A broker, however, is not similar to a DP. A broker is a member of the stock exchange and he buys and sells shares for his clients and for himself. </FONT></FONT><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>A DP, on the other hand, gives you an account where you can hold those shares. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>To get a list of the registered DPs, visit the NSDL and CDSL Web sites.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><STRONG>3. Get a PAN </STRONG></P>
<P>The taxman demands that you get yourself a Permanent Account Number. </P>
<P>This is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric number (AABPS1205E, for example) that identifies and tracks an individual in the taxman's database. </P>
<P>Almost every money transaction demands the use of a PAN. These include: </P>
<P>~ When you get a job</P>
<P>~ When you file an income tax return</P>
<P>~ When you open a bank account</P>
<P>~ When you deposit cash of Rs 50,000 or more in a bank</P>
<P>~ When you open a bank fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 or more</P>
<P>~ When you open a post office deposit of Rs 50,000 or more</P>
<P>~ When you buy/ sell shares and mutual funds</P>
<P>~ When you buy/ sell property</P>
<P>~ When you buy a vehicle</P>
<P>~ When you take a loan: home/ personal/ other</P>
<P>~ When you install a telephone (or buy a cell phone) </P>
<P>~ When you pay in cash to hotels and restaurants against bills for an amount exceeding Rs 25,000 at a time</P>
<P>~ You also need to mention it in every transaction you have with the tax officials. </P>
<P>If you are going through a tax consultant, you need not worry. He will supply you with Form 49A (the application form for the PAN number) and give you a list of the documents he needs.</P>
<P>However, if you believe in doing things on your own, the process is really not that tedious. </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>You could visit the official Web sites of the </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=4>Income Tax</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=4> department or </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=4>UTI Investor Services Ltd</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=4> or </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=4>National Securities Depository Limited</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=4>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>Download Form 49A from any of these sites and follow the instructions. </FONT></P>
<P>You should get your PAN in the form of a laminated card within a month. </P>

<P><STRONG>4. Check if you need a UIN</STRONG></P>
<P>This depends on how much you plan to invest. </P>
<P>The Unique Identification Number is the identification an investor needs to buy and sell shares or mutual fund units. </P>
<P>It is part of the Security and Exchange Board of India's attempt to create a database of all Market Participants and Investors, called MAPIN. </P>
<P>Who needs a UIN? </P>
<P>An investor who is involved in a single transaction of Rs 1,00,000 or more will have to quote his/ her UIN. </P>
<P>If you plan to be a prominent stock market player or a mutual fund investor and expect to deal with such huge amounts in the near future, you should get a UIN. </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>SEBI has appointed the National Securities Depositories Ltd that, in turn, has appointed Points Of Service agents. The NSDL Web site has a list of the POS agents. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>Visit the office of a POS agent. Make sure you take an appointment before you go. As part of the application process, your fingerprints will be scanned and a photograph taken. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><FONT face=Arial>All you have to do is fill and submit an application form (there are separate forms for corporates and individuals). You can also download the </FONT>form for an individual at the NSDL Web site. </FONT></P>
<P>Incidentally, the UIN is totally different from a PAN. The Permanent Account Number is an identification number for filing your income tax returns. </P>
